# Yathaarthi

## Introduction

Yathaarthi is a very easy to use **Shop Inventory, Transaction and Customer Loyalty Management System**. It is a web portal built for both a shopkeeper and customers. A shopkeeper can keep track of their shop's inventory, transaction and customer data while the customers can view their personal transaction history. This platform is built specifically for small shopkeepers who do not track their inventory/transaction data and need to implement a structured customer loyalty system based on points.

-view, add, and delete new and existing items from the inventory

-view customer details such as their name, mobile number, points and the total amount spent by them

-view transaction data and create new transactions


### Customers can:

-create account on the portal

-view their current points count and transaction history
